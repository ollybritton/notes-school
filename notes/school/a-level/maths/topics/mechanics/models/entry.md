# Models
##### What is a model??
A model is a simplified representation of a physical situation, made by accepting assumptions.

##### What's an example of a common assumption??
* No air resistance
* Constant gravity
* Uniform mass

##### What two questions need to be asked when setting up a mathematical model??
* What are your assumptions?
* What are the variables?

##### If the answer presented by a mathematical model is unreasonable, what should be done??
You should reconsider your assumptions.

## Modelling Assumptions
##### When should a _particle_ model be used??
When the dimensions of an object don't matter.

##### What are the two modelling assumptions for a _particle_??
* mass of the object is concentrated at a single point
* rotational forces and air resistance can be ignored

##### How is mass thought of in a _particle_ model??
Concentrated at a single point.

##### Should air resistance be taken into account using a _particle_ model??
No.

##### Should rotational forces be taken into account using a _particle_ model??
No.

##### Should gravity be taken into account using a _particle_ model??
Yes.

##### When should a _rod_ model be used??
When all dimensions of an object except one don't matter, like a pole or a beam.

##### What are the three modelling assumptions for a _rod_??
* mass is concentrated along a line
* no thickness
* rigid (does not bend or buckle)

##### How is mass thought of in a _rod_ model??
Concentrated along a line.

##### How is thickness thought considered in a _rod_ model??
There is no thickness.

##### How is rigidity considered in a _rod_ model??
The rod is completely rigid, it does not bend or buckle.

##### How many dimensions do you care about when using a rod??
1.

##### When should a _lamina_ model be used??
When the object has a surface area, but negligible thickness, like a sheet of paper.

##### What is the modelling assumption for a _lamina_??
* mass is distributed across a flat surface

##### How is mass thought of in a _lamina_ model??
As distributed across a flat surfae.

##### When is an object said to be a _uniform body_??
When the mass is distributed evenly.

##### How is mass considered in a _uniform body_??
As concentrated at a single point at the geometrical centre of the body, the centre of mass.

##### In a _uniform body_, where is the centre of mass??
At the geometric centre of the body.

##### When is an object said to be a _light object_ in mechanics??
When the mass of the object is small compared to the other masses, like a string or a pulley.

##### What modelling assumption can you make for a _light object_??
That it has no mass.

##### When a string is a _light object_, what can be said about the tension along the string??
That it is the same at both ends of the string.

##### What is the _inextensible string_ model??
A string that does not stretch under load.

##### What modelling assumption can be made for an _inextensible string_??
Acceleration is the same in objects connected by a tight inextensible string.

##### What can be said about the acceleration for objects at the end of a tight inextensible string??
It is constant, i.e. they cannot stretch the string and slow down.

##### When should a _smooth surface_ model be used??
When the surface in question is smooth, like ice.

##### What is the modelling assumption for a _smooth surface_??
There is no friction between the surface and any objects on it.

##### When should a _rough surface_ model be used??
When the surface is not smooth, like tarmac.

##### What modelling assumption do you make for a _rough surface_??
Objects on the surface experiece friction when:
* They are moving
* They are being acted on by another force

##### When should a _wire_ model be used??
To represent a rigid, thin length of metal.

##### What is the modelling assumption for a _wire_??
The object is one dimensional.

##### In mechanics A-level, what assumption do we make about all pulleys??
That they are smooth and light.

##### What two modelling assumptions do you make for a _smooth and light pulley_??
* Pulley has no mass
* Tension is the same on either side of the pulley

##### What is a _bead_ model??
A particle with a hole in it for threading on a wire or a string.

##### What two modelling assumptions do you make for _beads_??
* Moves freely along a wire or a string
* Tension is the same on either side of the bead

##### What is air resistance??
Friction or resistance experienced as an object moves through the air.

##### What usually occurs when modelling air resistance??
It is treated as negligible and not accounted for.

##### What is gravity??
A force of attraction between all objects.

##### What is the symbol for acceleration due to gravity??
$g$

##### What does the symbol $g$ mean in mechanics??
The acceleration due to gravity.

##### What is the value of $g$ in mechanics??
$9.8ms^{-2}$

##### What is the value of $g$ in physics??
$9.81ms^{-2}$

##### What two assumptions do we make about gravity in mechanics??
* Gravity is uniform across the Earth's surface
* Gravity acts vertically downwards

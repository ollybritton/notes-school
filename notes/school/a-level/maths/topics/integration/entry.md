##### What is $x^n$ integrated??
$$
\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + c
$$

##### What is $kx^n$ integrated??
$$
\frac{kx^{n+1}}{n+1} + c
$$

##### Integrate $2x+4$??
$$
x^2 + 4x + c
$$

##### What does $c$ mean in integration??
The constant of integration.

##### Why is a constant of integration important??
Because it represents any constant term that would dissapear when being differentiated.

##### What does it mean to find a particular solution of an integral??
Calculating the actual value of an integral but solving for the constant of integration.

##### If a general solution specifies a family of curves, what does a particular solution specify??
A single curve.

##### If you have a general solution to an integral and is told that the solution passes through a point, what are you then finding??
A particular solution.

##### If $\int 2x+4 dx = x^2 + 4x + c$ but the actual solution passes through $(1,9)$, how can you solve for $c$??
$$
1^2 + 4 \times 1 + c = 9 \\\\
1 + 4 + c = 9 \\\\
5 + c = 9 \\\\
c = 4
$$

##### What's the flow chart process for finding a particular solution to an integral??
$$
\text{integrate} \to \text{substitute} \to \text{solve}
$$

##### What is the first step for evaluating an integral $\int^b_a$??
Finding the antiderivative/indefinite integral $F(x)$.

##### If $f(x)$ is a function, what is the notation for the antiderivative of $f(x)$??
$$
F(x)
$$

##### When evaluating $\int^b_a$, what do you do with $F(x)$??
$$
F(b) - F(a)
$$

##### How can you visualise $F(b) - F(a)$ when finding the area under a curve??
Finding the area up to the upper bound $b$ and then subtracting the unneccesary area up to $a$.

##### Why does the integral symbol look like $\int$??
It's like a long S shape, representing a *s*um.

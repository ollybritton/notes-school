##### What is the derivative of $x^n$??
$$
nx^{(n-1)}
$$

##### What is the derivative of $ax^n$??
$$
anx^{(n-1)}
$$

##### What is $f'(x)$ where $f(x) = 4x^2$??
$$
8x
$$

##### What is $\frac{dy}{dx}$ for $y = \frac{1}{2} x^{-4}$??
$$
-2x^{-5}
$$

##### What is the derivative of $x^{\frac{1}{2}}$??
$$
-\frac{1}{2} x^{-\frac{1}{2}} \equiv -\frac{1}{2x^{\frac{3}{2}}}
$$

##### Differentiating a polynomial with a highest power $n$ means the power becomes??
$n-1$.

##### What is the sum rule for differentiation??
$$
h'(x) = af'(x) + bg'(x)
$$

##### What does the sum rule mean in practical terms??
That you can take the derivative of each term in a series, add them together and you get the derivative for the whole expression.

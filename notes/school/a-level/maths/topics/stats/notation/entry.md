# Notation
## $x$ in Algebra vs Stats
### Similarities
* Represent the value of some quality
* Variables can be discrete or continious
* Can be part of a larger calculation
	* For example, $2x$ could be double the heights of everyone.
	* This is known as [[Stats - Coding]].

### Differences
* Variables can represent multiple objects, like a set.
* Can do operations on $x$ like it's a collection of values:
	* $\sum x$, the sum of all values in $x$
	* $\bar{x}$, the mean of all values in $x$.

##### The main notational difference between stats and algebra for $x$ is??

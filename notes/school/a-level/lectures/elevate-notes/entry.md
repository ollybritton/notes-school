> This was part of a talk/lecture delivered on 2020-09-03.  
> ELEVATE is an organisation that interviewed top students and asked them what their process was in order to find out the best skills to have. This talk was a condensed version of that advice. 

### The Three Levels
Three levels to being a top student:

1. **LEARN**: Need to actually learn the information required
2. **MASTER**: Know how to apply what's been learnt
3. **CREATE**: Done something different that makes them stand out

### Learn
#### Rule 1: Use the Syllabus
* The syllabus is the document on the exam board's website containing all information about what you're learning.
* Find the assesment objectives (i.e. the things you need to learn)
* Can be 100% certain of what will be in the exam
* Make notes around the topics in the assesment objectives
* Cross-reference notes against syllabus
* Exam board websites
  * Syllabus
  * Past papers
  * Examiner reports -- important

#### Rule 2: Make Notes *During* Term Time
* Making notes as revision is __not effective__.
* Rewriting notes as revision is __not effective__.
* Rote learning is also __not effective__.
* Use a _note taking planner_
  * Check at the end of the week everything has been learned.

| **Finish Notes (3 weeks)** | **Memorize Notes (2 weeks)**                           | **Practice (1 week)**   |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Not starting them.         | Alternatively, use Anki so notes are always memorized. | Past papers, questions. |

#### Rule 3: Use a Folder for Each Subject
* Notes all in one place makes learning easier
* Rewriting notes is a waste of time, like a belt made of watches.
* Ordered notes improve memory (because our brain groups things together)

#### Rule 4: Pay Attention to Space and Colour
1. Most people can reduce the number of words in their notes by 80%
2. Colour code to improve memory, brain groups together.


### Master
#### Rule 1: Use a System of Review
* Make notes
* Review immediately
* Review 24h later
* Review monthly

Recall decreases over time. This is the problem Anki solves! See [the Spacing Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect). 

#### Rule 2: Use Mind Mapping
* Images and diagrams are easier to remember
* Mind maps become plans in the exam.

#### Rule 3: Practice/Past Papers
* Didn't have the experienmce of actual exams at GCSE, except from mocks
* 3 -5 past paers per exam
* First 3 open book
  * Don't want to force yourself into it, no stress
* Final questions/papers under exam conditions
* Get past papers marked

### Create
#### Rule 1: Extra Reading
* Do the extra reading as you go not all at the end
* Base extra reading on the syllabus - it's a waste of time otherwise.
* Check past exams
   * But don't tailor revision around past exam contents
* Look 4:
  * More in-depth facts then what's taught, lessons should be a foundation that gets built off of
  * Counter arguments or ideas (not so relevant for more 'pure' subjects like maths or physics)
  * Quotes and evidence
* Use a different colour for extra reading, keeps it speerate from core information.

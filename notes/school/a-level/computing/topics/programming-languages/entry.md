# Programming Languages
##### What is a low level programming language??
A programming language that provides little or no abstraction of a computer's instruction set.

##### What are the two parts of an instruction in machine code??
* The opcode
* The operand

##### What is the purpose of having an opcode and an operand??
What do you have (operand) and what do you want do with it (opcode).

##### What is an instruction set??
All the instructions that a computer can understand and exectue.

##### An operand can be either??
* An actual value
* An adress in memory to a value

##### What abstraction does assembly language provide for opcodes??
Each opcode is replaced by a mneumonic which gives a clue to the what the operation did.

##### What abstraction does assembly language provide for operands??
You can specify operands as decimal or hexadecimal instead of binary.

##### What is the key similarity between assembly and machine code??
There is a one-to-one correspondence between assembly language and machine code.

##### What does LDA mean??
Load address.

##### What does STO mean??
Store the value.

##### What is the main advantage for assembly instead of machine code??
* Don't have to manually type in 1s and 0s.
* Quicker

##### What is the main disadvantage for assembly instead of machine code??
You have to convert the assembly to machine code first.

##### How is assembly converted to machine code??
By an assembler.

##### What was the first high level language??
FORTRAN

##### What is an imperative high-level language??
A programming language that consists of commands for the computer to perform.

##### What is the opposite to an imperative high-level language??
Declarative language.

##### What is the main advantage of a declarative programming language??
You can focus on what the program should do without listing the steps needed to achieve the result.

##### SQL is what type of high-level language??
Declarative.

##### What is the main advantage for a high-level language??
The programmer can think and code in terms of algorithms rather than worrying about the computer will execute each tiny step.

##### What must happen to a high-level language before it can be executed??
It has to be converted to machine code.

##### What is meant by a portable programming language??
A program written for one type of computer can be recompiled for a different type of computer.

##### Why will a high-level language run slower??
Compiled code won't be as fast or optimised as raw assembly or machine code.

##### Why is larger object/machine code a problem for some environments??
In embedded com

##### What's an example of an imperative language??
C++

##### What's an example of a declerative language??
SQL

##### What are 1st generation programming languages??
Machine code

##### What are 2nd generation programming languages??
Assembly

##### What are 3rd generation programming languages??
Imperative programming languages

##### What are 4th generation programming languages??
Declearive programming languages

##### What are 5th generation programming languages??
Natural language/scratch-live programming languages.

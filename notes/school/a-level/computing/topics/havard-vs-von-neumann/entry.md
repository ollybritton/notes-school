##### What are the two types of architecture in computers??
* von Neumann
* Havard

##### Which computer architecture in the most common??
von Neumann architecture.

##### What is the von Neumann architecture?
Where instructions and data are stored in a common main memory and transferred using a single shared bus.

##### What is the Havard architecture??
Where instructions and data are stored in two seperate memories and each has a bus.

##### What is the main issue with von Neumann architecture??
Instructions and data are constantly competeting for use of the bus.

##### What consequence does Havard architechture have on the sizes of data and instructions??
Different sized memory spaces and word lengths can be used for data and instructions.

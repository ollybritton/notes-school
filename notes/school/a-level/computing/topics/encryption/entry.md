##### What is a summary of encryption??
A way of making sure data cannot be understood if you don't possess the means to decrypt it.

##### What is a Ceasar cipher??
A method of encryption where you shift the letters along by a consistent amount.

##### What is a brute-force attack??
Where you attempt every possible key to decrypt ciphertext until one works.

##### What is another name for a one-time pad??
A Vernam cipher

##### What is another name for a Vernam cipher??
A one-time pad

##### What is a Vernam cipher??
Where a random one-time pad greater or equal in length to the plaintext is exchanged and used to encrypt a message.

##### What is the advantage to a Vernam cipher??
It is completely unbreakable.

##### Why can't you use a one-time pad multiple times??
Because eventually the message will be able to be decrypted with frequency analysis.

##### What's an example decoding scheme for a Vernam cipher??
Do an XOR with all the bits of the message and the key.

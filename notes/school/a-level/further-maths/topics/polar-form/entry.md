##### What is the name for $|z|$??
The modulus of $z$.

##### What is the value of $|z|$, where $z = a + bi$??
$$
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
$$

##### What is the value of $|z|^2$, where $z = a + bi$??
$$
a^2 + b^2
$$

##### If $|z|^2 = a^2 + b^2$, how could you also write $|z|^2$??
$$
(a + bi)(a - bi)
$$

##### What is the word definition of the modulus of $z$??
The distance to $z$ from the origin.

##### What is the name for $\text{arg} z$??
The argument of $z$.

##### What is the word definition of the argument of $z$??
The angle that a line drawn to $z$ makes with the real axis, in the anticlockwise

##### What is the range of the argument $\theta$ of a complex number??
$$
-\pi < \theta \le \pi
$$

##### What typically are the units of $\text{arg} z$??
Radians.

##### What is the principal argument??
The argument of $z$ in the range $-\pi < \theta \le \pi$.

##### Assuming all points are some horizontal distance $a$ away from the origin and a vertical distance $b$ in ![PHOTO](argand-diagram-quadrants.png), how could you write the angle they make with the real axis??
$$
\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)
$$

##### In ![PHOTO](argand-diagram-quadrants.png), what is the formula in terms of $\alpha$ for the argument of $z$ for the first quadrant??
$$
\text{arg}z = \alpha
$$

##### In ![PHOTO](argand-diagram-quadrants.png), what is the formula in terms of $\alpha$ for the argument of $z$ for the second quadrant??
$$
\text{arg}z = \pi-\alpha
$$

##### In ![PHOTO](argand-diagram-quadrants.png), what is the formula in terms of $\alpha$ for the argument of $z$ for the third quadrant??
$$
\text{arg}z = -(\pi-\alpha)
$$

##### In ![PHOTO](argand-diagram-quadrants.png), what is the formula in terms of $\alpha$ for the argument of $z$ for the fourth quadrant??
$$
\text{arg}z = -\alpha
$$

##### Visualise the 4 quadrants of an Argand diagram??

##### What is the argument of $3 + 4i$, in terms of $\tan$??
$$
\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)
$$

##### What quadrant does $3 + 4i$ lie in??
The first quadrant.

##### What is the argument of $-3 + 4i$, in terms of $\tan$??
$$
\pi - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)
$$

##### What quadrant does $3 - 4i$ lie in??
The second quadrant.

##### What is the argument of $-3 - 4i$, in terms of $\tan$??
$$
-(\pi - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{4}{3}\right))
$$

##### What quadrant does $-3 - 4i$ lie in??
The third quadrant.

##### What is the argument of $3 - 4i$, in terms of $\tan$??
$$
-\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)
$$

##### What quadrant does $3 - 4i$ lie in??
The fourth quadrant.

##### What quadrant does $12 + 5i$ lie in??
The first quadrant.

##### What quadrant does $-3 + 6i$ lie in??
The second quadrant.

##### What quadrant does $-8 -7i$ lie in??
The third quadrant.

##### What quadrant does $2 - 2i$ lie in??
The third quadrant.

##### For $a + bi$, why shouldn't you put the signs of $a$ and $b$ in $\tan\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)$??
Because you're calculating the angle from a triangle, the lengths of the sides can't be negative.

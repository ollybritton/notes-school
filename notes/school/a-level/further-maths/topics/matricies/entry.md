##### When can you add matricies??
When they have the same dimensions.

##### When can you multiply matricies??
The columns of the first matrix equals the rows of the second matrix.

##### If two matricies are $m_1 \times n_1$ and $m_2 \times n_2$, how can you tell whether you can multiply them??
$$
n_1 = m_2
$$

$$
3 \times 9
$$

##### What's a one sentence explanation for matrix multiplication??
You multiply all the rows of the first matrix by the columns of the second matrix.

##### What's the co-ordinate matrix for \[A(2,1), B(2,7), C(5,1)\]??
\[
\begin{matrix} 2 & 2 & 5 \\ 1 & 7 & 1 \end{matrix}
\]

\]

##### What is a co-ordinate matrix??
A way of representing co-ordinates in a matrix, with all the co-ordinates top-down next to each other.

##### What is a transformation matrix??
A matrix which describes a transformation to a coordinate system.

##### How can you combine multiple transformation matricies??
Multiplying all the transformation matricies together.

##### How can you think of a transformation matrix??
As defining new, transformed values for the unit vectors $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$.

##### The rule for matricies that $(A \times B) \times C = A \times (B \times C)$ is known as??
The Law of Associativity.

##### How is matrix multiplication different from normal multiplication??
It is not commutative.

##### What's a way of describing something not being commutative??
$$
AB \neq BA
$$

##### What is the identity matrix??
The $m \times n$ matrix which does not change what it is multiplying.

##### What is the \[2 \times 2\] identity matrix??
\[
\begin{matrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{matrix}
\]

##### What is the \[3 \times 3\] identity matrix??
\[
\begin{matrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{matrix}
\]

##### $I$ in matricies means...??
The identity matrix.

##### What is the inverse matrix of a matrix??
A matrix that multiplies with the original matrix to give the $m \times n$ identity matrix.

##### What does $A^{-1}$ mean in matricies??
The inverse matrix of $A$.

##### How can you sort of define division for matricies??
Inversion, finding the matrix you can multiply both sides by to eliminate one of the matricies.

##### What does it mean for two matricies to be multiplicatively conformable??
They can be multiplied.

##### The fancy term for two matricies that can be multiplied is??
Multiplicatively conformable.

##### What does it mean for two matricies to be additively conformable??
They can be added.

##### The fancy term for two matricies that can be added is??
Additively conformable.

##### How can you think of the determinant of a transformation matrix??
The scale factor.

##### If a $2 \times 2$ matrix has a determinant of $4$, then what does that tell you about the transformation??
It increases the area by a factor of $4$.

##### If a $3 \times 3$ matrix has a determinant of $4$, then what does that tell you about the transformation??
It increases the volume by a factor of $4$.

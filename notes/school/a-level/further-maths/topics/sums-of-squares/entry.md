##### What is the formula for the sum of the squares of the $n$ natural numbers??
$$
\sum^{n}_{r=1} r^2 = \frac{1}{6}n(n+1)(2n+1)
$$

##### How could you rewrite $\sum^{n}_{r=1} r^2$??
$$
\frac{1}{6}n(n+1)(2n+1)
$$

##### What's another way of expressing $\frac{1}{6}n(n+1)(2n+1)$??
$$
\sum^{n}_{r=1} r^2
$$

##### How could you rewrite $\sum^{n}_{r=1} 3r^2$??
$$
\frac{1}{3}n(n+1)(2n+1)
$$

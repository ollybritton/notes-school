##### In summary, what is volumes of revolutions??
Finding volumes by integrating.

##### Rotating the line $y = x$ around the $x$ axis creates what shape??
A cone.

##### If you have a function $f(x)$ and an interval $[a,b]$, how can you find the volume of revolution around the $x$-axis??
$$
\int^b_a \pi f(x)^2 dx
$$

##### If normal integration is an infinite summation of rectangles, then volumes of revolutions is an infinite summation of??
Cylinders.

##### If you have a cylinder with radius $y$ and width $dx$, then what is the formula for the volume of that cylinder??
$$
\pi y^2 dx
$$

##### If you have a function $y = ...$ on the interval $[a,b]$, how can you find the volume of revolution around the $x$-axis??
$$
\int^b_a \pi y^2 dx
$$

##### If you have a function $y = ...$ on the interval $[a,b]$, how can you find the volume of revolution around the $y$-axis??
Rearrange for $x = ...$

$$
\int^b_a \pi x^2 dx
$$

##### If you have a function $f(x)$ and an interval $[a,b]$, how can you find the volume of revolution around the $y$-axis??
$$
\int^b_a \pi f^{-1}(x) dx
$$

##### How would you find the rotated volume of PHOTO??
PHOTO (a big volume minus a little volume)

##### How would you find the rotated volume of PHOTO 2??
PHOTO (a combination of two curves)

##### How would you find the rotated volume of PHOTO 3??
PHOTO (the intersection of two curves)

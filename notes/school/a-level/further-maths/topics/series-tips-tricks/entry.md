The sole purpose of this entry being seperate is so that I don't have to re-load the other [[Further Maths - Series]] into Anki because it's got some formatting issues that are down to underscores inside Latex formulas being recognised as italics rather than subscripts.

##### How can you rewrite $\sum^{n}_{r=1} (r+4)^3$??
$$
\sum^{n+4}_{r=1} r^3
+
\sum{4}_{r=1} r^3
$$

##### Why can you rewrite $\sum^{n}_{r=1} (r+4)^3$??
Because it's the same as a $r^3$ sequence starting at $5$.

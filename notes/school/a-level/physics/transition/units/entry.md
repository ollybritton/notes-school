Here are the unit prefixes:

| Multiple      | Prefix | Symbol |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| $10^{12}$     | tera-  | $T$    |
| $10^{9}$      | giga-  | $G$    |
| $10^{6}$      | mega-  | $M$    |
| $10^{3}$      | kilo-  | $k$    |
| $10^{0}\,(1)$ | -      | -      |
| $10^{-3}$     | milli- | $m$    |
| $10^{-6}$     | micro- | $\mu$  |
| $10^{-9}$     | nano-  | $n$    |
| $10^{-12}$    | pico-  | $p$    |

##### What is multiplier does tera/T represent??
$10^{12}$

##### What is multiplier does giga/G represent??
$10^{9}$

##### What is multiplier does mega/M represent??
$10^{6}$

##### What is multiplier does kilo/k represent??
$10^{3}$

##### What is multiplier does milli/m represent??
$10^{-3}$

##### What is multiplier does micro/Î¼ represent??
$10^{-6}$

##### What is multiplier does nano/n represent??
$10^{-9}$

##### What is multiplier does pico/p represent??
$10^{-12}$

##### Why are some SI units uppercase and some lowercase??
Because units named after people (e.g. `N` for Isaac Newton) are uppercase, whereas units not named after people are lower case.

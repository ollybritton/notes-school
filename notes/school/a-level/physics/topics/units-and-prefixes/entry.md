# Units and Prefixes
Units and Prefixes are a simple topic but very important and foundational for the rest of physics as a whole. It's one of those things that are important learning because it improves fluency in thought involving physics problems and having a good conceptual understanding of what the units actually represent can also be helpful.

## Units
##### What are the two types of units??
* Base units
* Compound units

##### What is a base unit??
Standard units of measurement from which all other SI units are derived.

##### What is a compound unit??
An SI unit created from a combination of base units.

##### What are the 6 base units??
* metre
* kilogram
* second
* Ampere
* Kelvin
* Mole

##### How do base units relate to base quantities??
Base units are standard units of measurement for the base quantities.

# Resolving Vectors
> This links to [[Physics - Combining Vectors]], since it's like doing it in reverse.

##### What is resolving vectors??
Finding the horizontal and vertical component of a vector.

##### What is resolving vectors opposite to...??
Combining a vector.

##### How is the the horizontal component of $F$ written??
$F_x$.

##### What is $F_x$??
The horizontal component of vector $F$.

##### How is the the vertical component of $F$ written??
$F_y$.

##### What is $F_y$??
The vertical component of vector $F$.

##### What are the components of a vector??
The horizontal and vertical vectors that are at right angles and combine to give the original vector.

##### What do the horizontal and vertical components of a vector look like??
PHOTO

##### What is the formula for the vertical component of a vector $F$??
$$
F_y = F \sin \theta
$$

##### What is the formula for $F_y$ of vector $F$??
$$
F_y = F \sin \theta
$$

##### What is the formula for the horizontal component of a vector $F$??
$$
F_x = F \cos \theta
$$

##### What is the formula for $F_x$ of vector $F$??
$$
F_x = F \cos \theta
$$

##### If you're moving through a force's angle, you use??
$$
F \cos \theta
$$

##### If you're moving away from a force's angle, you use??
$$
F \sin \theta
$$

##### What is $F_x + F_y$??
$$
F
$$

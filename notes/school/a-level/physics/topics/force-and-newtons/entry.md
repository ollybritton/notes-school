##### What is the wordy definition of Newton's second law of motion??
The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force ating on the object, is in the direction of the net force and is inversely proportional to the mass of the object.

##### What's the basic jist of Newton's second law of motion??
Acceleration is affected in two ways:

* Increased by more force
* Decreased by more mass

##### Acceleration is directly proportional to??
The net force ating on the object.

##### Acceleration is inversely proptional to??
The mass of the object.

##### What is the simple equation explaining Newton's second law of motion??
$$
F = ma
$$

##### What is the simple __word__ equation explaining Newton's second law of motion??
$$
\text{force} = \text{mass} \times \text{acceleration}
$$


##### What is the symbol formula for the momentum of a paritcle??
$$
p = mv
$$

##### What is the __word__ formula for the momentum of a particle??
$$
\text{momentum} = \text{mass} \times \text{velocity}
$$

##### What equation do you get if you substitute $a = \frac{v - u}{t}$ into Newton's second law??
$$
F = \frac{mv - mu}{t}
$$

##### In the alternate form of Newton's second law, $F = \frac{mv - mu}{t}$, what does $mv$ represent??
The final momentum.

##### In the alternate form of Newton's second law, $F = \frac{mv - mu}{t}$, what does $mv - mu$ represent??
The change in momentum.

##### What's another way of thinking about force using the equation $F = \frac{mv - mu}{t}$??
Force is the rate of change of momentum.

##### How do airbags reduce the force in a car crash, in terms of force and momentum??
Force is the rate of change of momentum. Air bags increase the amount of time it takes to slow down and therefore change momentum.

##### Why when proving Newton's Second Law with a cart and a mass, why is the cart on a slope??
To balance out the force of friction.

##### What angle should the slope be at when proving Newton's Second Law with a cart and a mass??
The angle where the cart will move without coming to a stop or accelerating.

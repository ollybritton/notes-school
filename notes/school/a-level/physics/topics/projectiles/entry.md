##### What is special about the horizontal and vertical components of a projectile??
They can be treated seperately.

##### If you have two bullets, one which is fired from a completely level gun and one that is dropped at the exact same height and time as the other bullet being fired, which lands first??
They both land at the same time.

##### Why do two bullets, one fired from a gun and one stationary, hit the ground at the same time??
The horizontal velocity of the first bullet does not affect the amount of time it takes to fall to the ground.

##### If you had an object $10m$ above the ground, which suvat equation could you use to calculate how long it took to fall??
$$
s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2
$$

##### For an object that is stationary $10m$ above the ground, which of the SUVAT variables do you know??
* $s = 10m$
* $u = 0ms^{-1}$
* $a = 9.81ms^{-2}$
* $t = ?$

##### How could you rearrange $s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2$ to calculate the amount of time before a stationary object hit the ground??
$$
\sqrt{\frac{2s}{a}}
$$

##### If a horizontal projectile travelling at $12ms^{-1}$ takes $1.5s$ to hit the ground, how far does horizontally does it travel away from where it started??
$$
18m
$$

##### If an object takes $1.5s$ to hit the ground, what is it's vertical velocity the moment it hits the ground assuming $g = 10ms^{-2}$??
$$
15ms^{-1}
$$

##### When calculating the final velocity for a projectile, what must you remember to do??
Find the resultant velocity of the horizontal and vertical components.

##### If a projectile has a final vertical velocity of $3ms^{-1}$ and a final horizontal velocity of $4ms^{-1}$, what is the final velocity??
$$
5ms^{-1}
$$

##### A runner moving at $8ms^{-1}$ and is about to take a dive off of a cliff. When he leaves the cliff, what is his initial vertical velocity??
$$
0ms^{-1}
$$

##### What are the vertical and horizontal components for ![PHOTO](cannon-no-components.jpg)??
![PHOTO](cannon-with-components.jpg)

##### Picture the trajectory of this projectile ![PHOTO](cannon-no-trajectory.jpg)??
![PHOTO](cannon-with-trajectory.jpg)

##### What is the vertical velocity of the projectile at point B in ![PHOTO](cannon-labelled-trajectory.jpg)??
$$
0ms^{-1}
$$

##### What is the vertical velocity of the projectile at point C in ![PHOTO](cannon-labellled-trajectory.jpg)??
$$
-80\sin 30^{\circ}
$$

##### Assuming no drag, why must a plane and a bomb cross the impact zone at the same time??
The horizontal velocity of the plane and the bomb is the same, only the bomb is being affected by gravity.

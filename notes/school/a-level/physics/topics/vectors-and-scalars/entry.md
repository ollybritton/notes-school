##### What is uniform acceleration??
Where the acceleration is constant during motion.

##### What is non-uniform acceleration??
Where the acceleration changes during motion.

##### Vector's quote in Dispicable Me is??
"I commit crimes with both direction and magnitude"

##### Mass is a vector/scalar quantity??
Scalar.

##### Energy is a vector/scalar quantity??
Scalar.

##### Velocity is a vector/scalar quantity??
Vector.

##### Speed is a vector/scalar quantity??
Scalar.

##### Displacement is a vector/scalar quantity??
Vector.

##### Distance is a vector/scalar quantity??
Scalar.

##### How could you describe the velocity of a object moving at a constant speed in a circle??
* Constantly changing velocity and therefore accelerating.
* Because the object is changing direction and velocity is a vector.

##### What does the distance-time graph look like for an object moving in a circle at a constant speed??

##### What is the biggest difference between physics at GCSE and at A-level??
* GCSE is thinking in one dimension
* A-level is thinking in two

##### What is the definition of a vector??
A vector has both a direction and a magnitude.

##### What is the definition of a scalar??
A quantity with only a magnitude??

##### What is the No.1 rule for adding vectors??
Always add them tip to tail.

##### What is the definition of velocity??
The rate of change of displacement.

##### What is the definition of acceleration??
The rate of change of velocity.

##### What does $s$ stand for in SUVAT??
Displacement.

##### What does $u$ stand for in SUVAT??
Initial velocity.

##### What does $v$ stand for in SUVAT??
Final velocity.

##### What does $a$ stand for in SUVAT??
Acceleration.

##### What does $t$ stand for in SUVAT??
Time.

##### What is the acronym for the equations of uniform motion??
SUVAT.

##### By considering PHOTO, what is a general equation for the area under the graph??
$$
\text{area} = ut + \frac{v - u}{2}
$$

##### What is the area under a velocity time graph??
Displacement.

##### What is the SUVAT equation for $v$ involving $u$, $t$ and $a$??
$$
v = u + at
$$

##### What is the SUVAT equation for $v^2$ involving $s$, $a$ and $u$?
$$
v^2 = u^2 + 2as
$$

##### What is the SUVAT equation for $s$ involving $u$, $t$ and $a$??
$$
s = ut + \frac{1}{2} a t^2
$$

##### What is the SUVAT equation for $s$ involving $v$, $t$ and $a$??
$$
s = vt - \frac{1}{2} a t^2
$$

##### In the formula for displacement $s$ involving $\frac{1}{2}at^2$, what's the two difference between the equations for $u$ and $v$??
$$
s = ut \oplus \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \\
s = vt \ominus \frac{1}{2} a t^2
$$

##### What is the SUVAT equation for $s$ involving $u$, $v$ and $t$??
$$
s = \frac{1}{2}(u + v)t
$$

##### What's the geometric interpretation behind $v = u + at$??

##### What is the key restriction to SUVAT equations??
They only work with uniform acceleration.

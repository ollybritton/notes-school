The Cornell note taking system is a system for taking notes, popularised by Cornell University. These are my notes on that note taking system. How meta.

The Cornell method divides the page into three: *cue*, *notes* and *summary*.

## Notes
This section is probably the most important as they are the notes themselves. This could be a distilled version of what the teacher is saying or key insights from a page in a textbook. It can include examples and diagrams.

## Cue
This is probably what makes the Cornell method so popular and useful. In this column, you write questions which prompt the answer next to it in the notes section. This helps your brain think analytically and really emphasises the importance of what is in the notes section.

## Summary
This is another important section. Basically, it's an answer to the question "What did learn today?". Summarising the topic helps formulate links in your head and makes it easier to remember.

This entry contains the shorthands I use for writing the names of textbooks in other entries. They're largely mneumonic.

- `smy1`: Edexcel AS and A level Mathematics, Statistics and Mechanics, Year 1/AS. Think "the red one with a guy on the front".
- `pfmy1`: Pure Further Maths Year 1, the green further maths one.

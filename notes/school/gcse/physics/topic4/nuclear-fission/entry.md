Nuclear fission is a type of nuclear reaction that is used to release energy from large and unstable atoms by splitting them up into smaller atoms. Nuclear fission is the opposite of [[Nuclear Fusion]]

##### How does nuclear fission release energy??
Nuclear fission releases energy by splitting atoms into smaller atoms.

##### What causes nuclear fission??
Fission rarely happens normally. A nucleus usually has to absorb a neutron before it will split.

##### Nuclear fission forms...??
Nuclear fission forms two new lighter elements that are roughly the same size from splitting an existing atom.

##### How can nuclear fission cause a chain reaction??
Nuclear fission can form a chain reaction when the neutrons released from one atom splitting are absorbed by another atom which itself can cause nuclear fission.

##### What are the two ways the energy from nuclear fission is released??
1. As the kinetic energy of the products.
2. By gamma rays.

##### How can the energy from nuclear fission be make use of??
The energy carried away by gamma rays and in the kinetic energy stores of the remaining free neutrons can be uysed to heat water, making steam to turn turbines and generators. This is how nuclear reactors work.

##### How can you control the amount of energy produced by nuclear fission??
The amount of energy produced by fission in a nuclear reactor is controlled by changing how quickly the chain reaction can occur. This is done using control rods, which are lowered and raised inside a nuclear reactor to absorb neutrons, slow down the chain reaction and control the amount of energy released.

##### How do nuclear weapons work in the context of nuclear fission??
Uncontrolled nuclear fission chain reactions can lead to lots of energy being released as an explosion.

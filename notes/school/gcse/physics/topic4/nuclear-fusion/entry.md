Nuclear fusion is a type of nuclear reaction that produces energy by having two light nuclei colliding at high speed to fuse and create a larger, heavier nucleus. In this regard it is the opposite of [[Nuclear Fission]].

##### How does nuclear fusion release energy??
In nuclear fusion, two light nuclei collide at high speed and fuse together to create a larger, heavier nucleus. For example, hydrogen nuclei can fuse to produce a helium nucleus.

##### How is energy released from nuclear fusion??
The heavier nucleus produced by fusion does not have as much mass as the two seperate, light nuclei did. Some of the mass of the lighter nuclei is converted to energy. This energy is released as radiation.

##### Which produces more energy, nuclear fission or nuclear fusion??
Fusion releases a lot of energy, more than fission for a given mass of fuel.

##### Why haven't scientists found a way of using fusion to generate energy for us to use??
The temperatures and pressures needed for fusion are so high that fusion reactors are really hard and expensive to build.

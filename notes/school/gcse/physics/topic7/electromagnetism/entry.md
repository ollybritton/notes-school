Electromagnetism is where a magnetic field is produced in a wire with a current passing through it.

## Moving Charges and Magnetism
##### What happens when a current flows through a wire, in the context of magnetism??
A magnetic field is created around the wire, made up of concentric circles perpendicular to the wire, with the wire in the centre.

##### What is the right-hand thumb rule??
The right-hand thumb rule is a way of working out the direction of a magnetic field in a wire. Using your right hand, point your thumb in the direction of current and curl your fingers. The direction of your fingers is the direction of the field.

##### How does changing the direction of current affect a wire's magnetic field??
Changing the direction of current changes the direction of the magnetic field, the Right-Hand Thumb Rule can be used to work out which way it goes.

##### How does the strength of a wire's magnetic field change??
The closer you are to the wire, the stronger it is. The more current flowing through the wire, the stronger it is.

## Electromagnets
##### How can you increase the strength of a magnetic field a wire produces??
You can increase the strength of a magnetic field a wire produces by wrapping the wire into a coil called a solenoid.

##### Why is the magnetic field in a solenoid stronger??
Wrapping loops of wire into a coil means that the field lines around each loop of wire line up with each other. This results in a lot of lines being very close together which increases the strength of the magnetic field.

##### What properties does the magnetic field in a solenoid have??
1. The magnetic field is very strong
2. The magnetic field is uniform, it has the same strength and direction at every point in the wire.

##### How can you further increase the strength of a solenoid??
You can increase the strength of a solenoid by placing a block of iron at the centre of the coil. This iron core becomes an induced magnet whenever the current is flowing through the solenoid.

##### What is an electromagnet??
An electromagnet is a solenoid with an iron core. This means that the magnetic field can be turned on and off with an elecric current.

## Uses of Electromagnets
##### What properties of electromagnets make them useful??
* They can be turned on and off.
* They can create a varying force.

##### How does a crane use electromagnets to pick up magnetic materials??
A crane can switch on its electromagnet when it needs to pick stuff up and then it can be switched off when you want to drop it.

##### How can an electromagnet be used as a switch in an electric circuit??
When the electromagnet is turned on, it can attract the iron contact on a "rocker" which causes it to pivot and close the contacts in another circuit.

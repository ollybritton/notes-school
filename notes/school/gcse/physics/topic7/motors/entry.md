Motors work by using the [[The Motor Effect]]. If we place a wire in a magnetic field, it will experience an upwards force:

```
---|       >   |---
 N |     /     | S 
---|   /       |---
```

If we swap the direction of the current, it will experience a downwards force instead. In order to make something that spins, we could have a coil of wire which enters the magnetic field with a current flowing in one direction and leaves it again flowing in the opposite direction:

```
      |-------|
---|  |       |  |---
 N |  /\      \/ | S 
---|  |       |  |---
      |--| |--|
         P N
```

Since each side experiences a force in the opposite direction, it means this coil will turn. However, after a 180 degree turn the positive and negative terminals will have swapped sides. This would mean that the forces would be opposite and it would do another 180 degree turn, this time in the opposite direction (i.e. clockwise -> anticlockwise and vice versa).

This isn't very useful for a motor. To fix this, we need to change the direction of the current at every half turn. There is a device called a split-ring commutator which swaps the positive and negative connections very half turn.

##### What electromagnetic effect allows motors to work??
The motor effect?

##### How does a motor work??
A motor works by using a coil of wire that loops through a magnetic field. Since either side of this coil will experience an opposite force, the coil will rotate. However, the direction of the current needs to be swapped ever half turn other wise it would turn clockwise and then anticlockwise. To achieve this, a split-ring commutator is used which swaps the positive and negative connections every half turn. This allows a motor to rotate in the same direction.

##### How can you change the direction of a motor??
By changing the direction of the current or by swapping the magnetic field's poles around.

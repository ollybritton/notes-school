## Alternators
##### How do alternators generate a current??
Generators rotate a coil in a magnetic field, which induces a current in the coil thanks to [[The Generator Effect]]. An alternator's construction is pretty much like [[Motors]], with a coil of wire between two ends of a magnet. The only difference is that there is no split-ring commutator so the direction doesn't change every half turn. This means they produce an alternating potential difference.

## Dynamos
##### What kind of current do dynamos generate??
Dynamos generate direct current.

##### How do dynamos generate current??
Dynamos rotate a coil in a magnetic field, which induces a current in the coil thanks to [[The Generator Effect]]. A dynamo's construction is pretty much like [[Motors]], with a coil of wire between two ends of a magnet. As the coil of wire rotates, the split-ring commutators swaps the current every half turn to keep the current flowing in the same direction.

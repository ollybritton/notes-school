## Magnetic Fields
##### What poles does a magnet have??
A magnet has two poles, north and south.

##### What do all magnets produce??
All magnets produce magnetic fields, a region where other magnets or magnetic matierals experience a non-contact force.

##### How can you visualise a magnetic field??
You can visualise a magnetic field by drawing magnetic field lines, lines going from north to south and that show which way a force would act on a north pole if it was put at that point in the field.

##### How can you interpret a magnetic field lines diagram??
The closer together the lines are, the stronger the magnetic field.

##### Where is a magnetic field the strongest??
A magnetic field is strongest at the poles of a magnet. It also means that the magnetic forces are also strongest at the poles.

##### What are the two types of magnetic forces??
The two types of magnetic forces are attraction and repulsion. If like poles of two magnets (e.g. both north) are put next to each other, the force will be repulsive. Two unlike poles will attract each other.

##### The force between a magnet and a magnetic material is always??
Attractive, no matter the pole.

## Compasses
##### How do compasses work??
Inside a compass is a tiny bar magnet. The north pole of this magnet is attracted to the south pole of any other magnet it is near. This means the compass points in the direction of the magnetic field it is in.

##### How can you use a compass to build up a picture of what a magnetic field looks like??
Compasses always point in the direction of the magnetic field it's in. You can move it around a magnet and trace the position it points in to visualise the magnetic field.

##### Which way do compasses point when they're not near a magnet??
Compasses not near a magnet always point north. This is because the earth generates its own magnetic field which means the core of the Earth must be magnetic.

## Permanent and Induced Magnets
##### What are the two types of magnets??
Permanent magnets, which produce their own magnetic field and induced magnets, which turn into a magnet when they're put into an existing magnetic field.

##### The force between a magnet and an induced magnet is always??
Attractive.

##### What happens to an induced magnet when you take away the magnetic field it's in??
When you take away the magnetic field, induced magnets quickly lose their magnetism and stop producing their own magnetic field.

## Questions
##### What is the difference between permanent and induced magnets??
1. Permanant magnets always produce a magnetic field, induced magnets only do so when in a magnetic field itself.

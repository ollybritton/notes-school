## [[Magnets]]
##### What is a magnetic field??
A magnetic field is the region around a magnet where a force acts on another magnet or on a magnetic material.

##### What are three magnetic materials??
* Iron
* Nickel
* Cobalt

##### In what direction do magnetic field lines point??
From north to south.

##### How could you use a compass to show the direction of a bar magnet's magnetic field lines??
You would place the magnet around the bar magnet in several different locations and trace the direction that it pointed in.

##### What is the behaviour of a compass far away from a magnet??
The compass will point to north, aligning itself with the Earth's magnetic field.

##### True or false, the force between a magnet and a magnetic material is always repulsive??
False, the force between a magnet and a magnetic material is always attractive.

##### What happens to an induced magnet when it is moved far away from a permenant magnet??
It quickly loses its magnetic field.

## [[Electromagnetism]]
##### What does the magnetic field around a current carrying wire look like??
The magnetic field around a current carrying wire forms concentric circles running clockwise from the wire.

##### Why does adding more turns to a solenoid increase the strength of its magnetic field??
More loops in a solenoid means that the field lines around each individual loop of wire line up with each other. This results in a lot of lines being very close together which increases the strength of the magnetic field.

##### What is an electromagnet??
An electromagnet is a solenoid with an iron core.

##### What's an example usage of an electromagnet??
1. For usage in a crane
2. As a switch in an eletrical circuit

## [[The Motor Effect]]
##### Why does a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field experience a force??
Because the magnetic field of the current-carrying conductor interacts repulsively with the other magnetic field.

##### What is the equation for calculating the strength of the Motor Effect??
$$
F = BIl
$$

Where:
* $F$ = Force (newtons, N)
* $B$ = Magnetic flux density (teslas, T)
* $I$ = Current (amps, A)
* $l$ = Length (metres, m)

##### What are three ways you could increase the force on a current-carying wire in a magnetic field??
1. Increase the current
2. Increase the strength of the magnetic field
3. Increase the amount of loops around the current-carying wire

##### What is Fleming's Left-Hand rule??
Fleming's left hand rule is a way of finding the direction of the force produced by the motor effect.

1. Using your left hand, point your first finger in the direction of the magnetic field (**F**irst **F**inger **F**ield)
2. Point your second finger in the direction of the current (se**C**ond finger **C**urrent)
3. Your thumb will point in the direction of the force (thu**M**b **M**otion)

## [[Motors]]
##### How does a basic DC motor work??
A motor works by using a coil of wire that loops through a magnetic field. Since either side of this coil will experience an opposite force, the coil will rotate. However, the direction of the current needs to be swapped ever half turn other wise it would turn clockwise and then anticlockwise. To achieve this, a split-ring commutator is used which swaps the positive and negative connections every half turn. This allows a motor to rotate in the same direction.

## [[The Generator Effect]]
##### How can you induce a current using the generator effect??
If you move a wire through a magnetic field (either by moving the wire or by moving the magnetic field itself), a current will be generated in the wire.

##### What are two ways you could reverse the direction of an induced current??
1. Move in the opposite direction
2. Reverse the magnet's magnetic field

##### True or false, induced currents create magnetic fields that oppose the change that made them??
True.

##### What are three ways you can increase the size of an induced potential difference??
1. Increase the strength of the magnet
2. Increase the speed of the movement
3. Increase the amount of coils in the wire

## [[Generators]]
##### What type of generator uses slip rings and brushes??
An alternator.

##### What kind of current do dynamos produce??
Dynamos produce DC current.

## [[Microphones]]
##### How does a microphone translate sound waves into electrical signals??
Microphones are basically [[Loudspeakers]] in reverse, with a coil of wire wrapped around a cone and next to a permenant magnet. Sound waves hit the cone and which in turn moves the wire that is connected to it. This movement of wire in the permenant magnet's magnetic field generates a current because of [[The Generator Effect]]. The movement of the coil (and so the generated current) depends on the properties of the sound wave (louder sounds make the cone move further).

## [[Transformers]]
##### What kind of current are transformers used with??
Alternating current.

##### Why do transformers have a core of iron??
Because iron is a magnetic material.

##### True or false, step-down transformers have more coils on their primary coil than on their secondary??
True.

##### If a transformer has an input potentiall difference of 100V and an output potential difference of 20V, what kind of transformer is it??
A step-down transformer.

##### What is the transformer equation??
$$
\frac{V_p}{V_s} = \frac{n_p}{n_s}
\text{  or  }
\frac{V_s}{V_p} = \frac{n_s}{n_p}
$$

Where:

* $V_p$ is the input potential difference (V)
* $V_s$ is the output potential difference (V)
* $n_p$ is the number of turns on the primary coil
* $n_s$ is the number of turns of the secondary coil

##### What is the equation that relates the input and output potential differences of transformers??
$$
V_s I_s = V_p I_p
$$

Where:

* $V_s$ is the potential difference across the secondary coil (V)
* $I_s$ is the current through the secondary coil (A)
* $V_p$ is the potential difference across the primary coil (V)
* $I_p$ is the current through the primary coil (A)

##### How are transformers used to improve efficiency when transmitting electricity??
Step up transformers are used when transmitting electricity over large distances. This means the potential difference gets increased to roughly 400,000V. This reduces the current which stops energy being lost as heat to the surroundings.

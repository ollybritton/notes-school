##### How do microphones work??
Microphones are basically [[Loudspeakers]] in reverse, with a coil of wire wrapped around a cone and next to a permenant magnet. Sound waves hit the cone and which in turn moves the wire that is connected to it. This movement of wire in the permenant magnet's magnetic field generates a current because of [[The Generator Effect]]. The movement of the coil (and so the generated current) depends on the properties of the sound wave (louder sounds make the cone move further).

## Loudspeakers in Reverse
One key insight here is that because the set up for a microphone is almost identical to [[Loudspeakers]], you can actually use a speaker as a microphone if you set it up right. There's [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LroLf0c2fKM) by the Berklee College of Music which demonstrates this.

##### What is the generator effect??
The generator effect is the induction of a potential difference (and current if there's a complete circuit) in a wire which is moving relative to a magnetic field, or experiencing a change in magnetic field.

##### What is another name for the generator effect??
Electromagnetic induction.

##### How can you cause the generator effect??
By moving a magnet in a coil of wire or moving a conductor in a magnetic field.

##### How can you reverse the potential difference/current caused by the generator effect??
If you move the magnet or conductor in the opposite direction, the potential difference/current will be reversed. Furthermore if the polarity of the magnet is reversed, then the potential difference/current will be reversed too.

##### How can you cause an alternating current using the generator effect??
If you move the magnet or coil backwards and forwards, you produce a potential difference that keeps swapping direction, i.e. an alternating current. You can also rotate the magnet end to end in a coil because with every half turn the direction of the magnetic field flips so the current flows in the opposite direction.

##### How can you increase the strength of the generator effect??
1. Increase the speed of the movement.
2. Increase the strength of the magnetic field.
3. Increase the amount of coils in the wire.

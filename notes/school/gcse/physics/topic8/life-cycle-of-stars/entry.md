Stars go through several different stages in their lifetime, starting as a cloud of dust and gas and eventually forming black dwarfs (if the star is small) or neutron stars and black holes (if the star is big)

## Stages
##### What are stages in a star's life cycle?
1. Cloud of dust and gas
2. Protostar
3. Main sequence star
4. Red giant -> White dwarf -> Black dwarf if it's a small/medium sized star
5. Red super giant -> Supernova -> Neutron star/Black hole if it's a large star

##### How do stars initially form??
Stars initially form from a cloud of dust and gas called a nebula. The force of gravity pulls the dust and gas together to form a protostar. The temperature rises as the star gets denser and more particles collide with each other. When the temperature gets hot enough, hydrogen nuclei undergo [[Nuclear Fusion]] to form helium nuclei. This gives out huge amounts of energy, which keeps the core of the star hot. A star is born.

##### What is a star called when its in its long stable period??
A main sequence star.

##### Why do stars enter a long stable period??
A star enters a long stable period when the outward pressure of the [[Nuclear Fusion]] trying to expand the star balances the force of gravity pulling everything inwards. In this stable period it's called a main sequence star and it typically lasts several billion years.

##### What type of star is the Sun??
  
The sun is a main sequence star, in the middle of its long stable period.

##### What happens after a small/medium sized star runs out of hydrogen??
  
When a small/medium star runs out of hydrogren, it swells into a red giant, becoming red because the surface cools. [[Nuclear Fusion]] of helium occurs and heavier elements (all the way up to iron) are created in the core of the star.

##### What happens when a red giant becomes unstable??
  
If a red giant becomes unstable it will eject its outer layer of dust and gas. This leaves behind a hot, dense solid core -- a white dwarf.

##### What happens as a white dwarf cools down??

As a white dwarf cools down, it emits less and less energy. When it no longer emits a significant amount, it's called a black dwarf.

##### What happens when a large sized star runs out of hydrogen??

When a large star runs out of hyrdrogen, it swells into a red super giant, becoming red because the surface cools. [[Nuclear Fusion]] of helium occurs and heavier elements (all the way up to iron) are created in the core of the star.

##### What happens next after a large star becomes a red super giant??

The star will begin to glow brightly again as they undergo more [[Nuclear Fusion]] and expand and contract several times, forming elements *heavier than iron* in various nuclear reactions. Eventually they'll explode in a supernova, forming elements heavier than iron and ejecting them into the universe to form new planets and stars. Stars and their life cycles produce and distribute all naturally occuring elements.

##### What happens after a star has exploded in a supernova??

The supernova will leave a very dense core called a neutron star. If the star is massive enough, it will become a black hole. A super dense point in space that not even light can escape from.

## Questions
##### Describe the life cycle of a star much larger than our Sun, from its main sequence onwards??
* The star will eventually run out of hydrogen and will swell up into a red super giant.
* [[Nuclear Fusion]] of helium and other elements and elements up to iron are formed in the core of the star.
* As it undergoes more [[Nuclear Fusion]], it expands and contracts several times and forms elements as heavy as iron in nuclear reactions.
* It explodes in a supernova, throwing outer layers of dust and gas into space.
* After a supernova, a very dense core called a neutron star is left. If the star is massive enough it will become a black hole.

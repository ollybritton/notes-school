## [[The Life Cycle of Stars]]
##### What is a nebula??
A nebula is a cloud of dust and gas that forms protostars.

##### What causes the rise in temperature that leads to fusion in a protostar??
As the protostar gets more dense, it increases in temperature.

##### What causes a main sequence star to remain stable for a long time??
A main sequence star remains stable as the force of gravity holding everything together is the roughly same as the outward pressure of [[Nuclear Fusion]]

##### What happens to a star about the same size as our Sunw hen it begins to run out of hydrogen??
The star turns into a red giant, turning a red hue as the surface cools.

##### What is a black dwarf and how is it made??
A black dwarf is when a white dwarf doesn't produce a significant amunt of energy. It is made whena white dwarf cools down.

##### At what stage in a star's life cycle are elements heavier than iron formed??
When a red giant undergoes [[Nuclear Fusion]].

##### True or False, the Sun will eventually turn into a black hole??
False. The sun is not big enough to turn into a Red Super Giant, instead forming a Red Giant.

## [[The Solar System and Orbits]]
##### How many stars are there in our solar system??
There is 1 star in our solar system -- the sun.

##### What do planets and dwarf planets orbit??
A star.

##### True or false, the Moon is an artificial satallite??
False, unless you're a crazy conspiracy theorist.

##### What galaxy is our solar system part of??
The milky way.

##### What is the approximate shape of the planets' orbits around the Sun??
A circle.

##### True or false, an object in stable orbit has a continually changing speed??
False, it has a continually changing velocity as it's changing direction but speed is a scalar quantity.

##### What is the name of the force that pulls an orbiting object towards Eath??
Gravity.

##### What is the direction of an oribiting satallites' instantaneous velocity in relation to the gravitional force pulling it towards the object its orbiting??
It is at a right angle to the gravitional force pulling it towards what it's orbitting.

##### How does the strength of a planet's gravitational force change as you get closer to its surface??
It increases.

##### What happens to the speed of an orbiting object if its orbital radius increases??
It will decrease as it's further away from what it's orbiting and doesn't need to go as fast to not crash into what it's orbitting.

## [[Red-Shift and the Big Bang]]
##### What is red-shift??
The light from galaxies being shifted towards the red end of the light spectrum due to the doppler effect.

##### True or false, very distant galaxies are moving away faster than ones closer to us??
True.

##### Give two limitations to the balloon model of the expanding universe??
1. Baloons don't stretch indefinitely.
2. There would be galaxies inside the balloon too.

##### What is a brief description of the Big Bang Theory??
The Big Bang theory is that all the matter in the universe initially existed in a very small space which was dense and therefore very hot. It then exploded and sent all galaxies accelerating away.

##### What did scientists in 1998 discover about the movement of galaxies??
Scientists discovered that galaxies are moving away from us.

##### True or false, new evidence that disproves a popular theory is ignored??
False.

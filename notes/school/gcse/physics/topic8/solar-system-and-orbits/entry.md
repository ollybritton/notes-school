## Definitions
### Planets
##### What is the definition of a planet??
These are large objects that orbit a star. They have to be large enough to have "cleared their neighbourhoods", in other words that their gravity is strong enough to have pulled in any nearby objects apart from their natural satellite.

##### How many planets are there in our solar system??
There are 8 planets in our solar system.

##### What are the planets in our solar system, in closest-to-sun order??
The planets in our solar system are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.

### Dwarf Planets
##### What is the definition of a Dwarf Planet??
A dwarf planet is a planet-like object that orbits stars, but don't meet all the rules for being a planet.

### Moons
##### What is the definition of a moon??
A moon is a type of natural satellite (i.e. a floaty thing in space that's not man-made) that orbits a planet.

### Satellites
##### What is the definition of a satellite??
A satellite is an object that orbits a second, more massive object.

##### What is the definition of an artificial satellite??
An artificial satellite is a satellite that humans have built. They generally orbit earth.

## Orbits
##### In what regard is a planet orbiting the Sun constantly accelerating??
Since the planet is travelling in a circle, it is constantly changing direction, which means it is constantly accelerating. Remember that acceleration and velocity is a vector quantity so direction is taken into account too.

##### How does gravity cause orbits??
The force of gravity is constantly acting on a planet, pulling it towards the centre of whatever it is orbiting. This force would cause the object to just fall towards whatever it was orbiting, but as the object is already moving, it just causes it to change direction since the planet has an instantaneous velocity. The force that makes this happen is provided by the gravitational force (gravity) between the planet and the Sun (or between a planet and its satalites).

TODO: explain this better.

##### What happens to the force of gravity as you get closer to an object??
The force of gravity as you get closer to an object, the stronger the gravitational force is.

##### Why do satallites orbiting closer to an object need to go faster?
The closer an object is, the stronger the force of gravity. Therefore the satallite will need to go faster so that it doesn't crash into the thing it's orbiting.

##### What happens if an object in stable orbit changes speed?
If an an object in stable orbit changes speed, the size (radius) of its orbit must do so too.

## Questions
##### What is one difference between natural and artificial satellites??
Artificial-satallies are man-made (i.e. made by humans) whereas natural satallites are not.

##### How would the orbital speed of the Moon change if the distance between the Moon and the Earth was smaller?
The speed would increase because satallites closer to a star or planet need to go faster in order to not crash into what they're orbitting.

##### What causes red-shift??
The doppler effect.

##### How does observed light from distant galaxies suggest that the universe is expanding??
The wavelength of the light has increased and has shifted towards the red end of the spectrum (this is called red-shift). This suggests that the source of light is moving away from us, thanks to the Doppler Effect. This conclusion appears to be that the universe is expanding.

##### What is the Big Bang Theory??
The Big Bang theory is based on the fact that light from distant galaxies is red-shifted so they are moving away from us and something must have gotten them going. The theory suggests that this was a big explosion. Initially, all the matter in the universe occupied a very small space. Since it was so dense, it was very hot.

This caused an explosion which meant space started expanding and the expansion is still going on.
